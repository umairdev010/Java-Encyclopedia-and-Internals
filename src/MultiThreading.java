        // MULTITHREADING
        // Java provides built in multithreading.
        // Multithreading means program contains two and more parts which running concurrently.
        // Each part which is running concurrently is known as thread.
        // And each part has its own execution.
        // Multithreading is specialized as multitasking.
        // There are two types od multitasking.
        // 1. Process based 2. Thread based
        // A process is in generally the program which running.
        // so process based multitasking allow your computer to run two and more program at a time.
        // In process based multitasking program is the smallest unit of code dispatch by scheduler.

        // In Thread based multitasking thread is the smallest unit of dispatched code.

        // Generally multithread give us the power of writing efficient programs that use maximum power of processor.

        // JAVA THREAD MODEL
        // Single thread system use an approach called event loop. (like in JavaScript).
        // But in java pooling mechanism is eliminated.
        // Here a thread can pause without stopping other parts of the program.
        // If a thread blocks in java. that thread stops but else all continue to run.
        //
