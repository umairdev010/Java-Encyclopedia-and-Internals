        // Multithreading means program contains two and more parts which running concurrently.
        // Each part which is running concurrently is known as thread.
        // And each part has its own execution.
        // Multithreading is specialized as multitasking.
        // There are two types od multitasking.
        // 1. Process based 2. Thread based
        // A process is in generally the program which running.
        // so process based multitasking allow your computer to run two and more program at a time.
        // In process based multitasking program is the smallest unit of code dispatch by scheduler.

        // In Thread based multitasking thread is the smallest unit of dispatched code.
        //
